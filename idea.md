++ New main feature for protohub
Whiteboard implementation with realtime stream.
 - User clicks on a button to start a Socket.IO realtime stream.
 - User can then share the link or others in the project get notified per email
 - A new socket connection gets established on a free port (currently 3000)

 Benefits:
 - Users can plan or present new ideas much better and faster than just with text.
